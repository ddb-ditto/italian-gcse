# Working on this repository

A two-year Edexcel GCSE Italian (1IN0) course, published as a static Astro site
through GitHub Pages. `README.md` says how to run and publish it; `DECISIONS.md`
says why it is the way it is and is worth reading before arguing with it. This
file is the part that is easy to get wrong.

## The shape of the work

Adding to the course is adding files. A session is
`src/content/sessions/<uu>-<n>.mdx` and its deck is
`src/data/decks/<uu>-<n>.json` — the same name, and a session is not finished
until its deck exists. A unit adds `src/content/units/unit-<uu>.mdx`. Nothing
central needs editing: the unit page, session page, deck page, record sheet and
navigation are all generated.

**The template owns the shape of a page.** A unit file's body is its
introduction and nothing else — the can-do list, the `insist` note and the
`contingency` list are frontmatter, and `src/pages/units/[unit]/index.astro`
decides where they go. Do not write a can-do list, a "Can-do check" heading, a
session list or a contingency section into a unit's body: the template already
renders all four, and doing both is how Unit 1 ended up printing its can-dos
twice.

## House rules for content

- **Nobody real appears.** Where a lesson needs a name it is invented and
  Italian, or a role. The Unit 1 dialogue runs between *You* and *Child*, and
  the slot where a name belongs is written `[name]`. Never a real name.
- **Nothing is dated.** Timelines are `Year 1 · autumn` … `Year 2 · May/June`.
  No calendar years — the course does not start in a particular September. If
  an external deadline must be described, say what it *has* been and tell the
  reader to check their own year.
- **Do not assume how many children.** "A child", "them", "each learner". Where
  it genuinely matters, "if you are teaching more than one".
- **No pointing outside the site.** No local folders, no "see the tracker", no
  "in this folder". A reader has a browser and nothing else.
- **Check a claim against the rest of the page.** "Nothing but a recorder and
  these pages" sat directly above a box demanding a notebook for every session.

## House rules for code

- **Scoped styles do not reach elements JavaScript creates.** Astro scopes a
  component's CSS with a `data-astro-cid-*` attribute that only elements written
  in the file receive. `document.createElement("button")` gets no such
  attribute, so `.chip { … }` in `Flashcards.astro` compiled to a selector that
  could never match and the deck chips rendered as bare boxes reading
  "Vowels5". Hang such rules off a static ancestor — `.decks :global(.chip)` —
  which is in the markup and does carry the attribute.
- **Inline HTML in a prop needs `set:html`.** `lead`, `insist` and
  `contingency` items carry `<em>` and `<strong>`. Rendering them as `{value}`
  prints the tags.
- **MDX is JSX.** Void tags self-close, a list item must be on one line, and a
  bare `<` in prose is read as a tag.

## Before committing

```
npm run build
python3 tools/check_site.py     # drives the built site in a real browser
python3 tools/check_paths.py    # no local file paths — CI runs this too
```

`check_site.py` is not decoration. Every failure this project has shipped was
silent — nothing threw, the page just looked wrong — so it asserts computed
styles and positions, not only text. When you fix a bug of that kind, add the
assertion that would have caught it.

**Verify in the browser, not by grepping the HTML.** Astro's entity encoding
does not match what you expect, and a `grep` that returns 0 will convince you a
working feature is broken. It has already happened once.

## Publishing

Push to `main`. The workflow checks, builds and deploys; the site is at
`https://ddb-ditto.github.io/italian-gcse/`, which is why `astro.config.mjs`
sets `base: "/italian-gcse"`. Ref deletions and general outbound HTTPS are
blocked from the agent sandbox, so deleting a branch or opening the live URL is
a job for whoever is at a real machine.
